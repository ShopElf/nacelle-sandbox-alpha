              It's important to provide your users with an explanation of your privacy
              policy in order to comply with data privacy laws such as

                href="https://gdpr.eu/"
                target="_blank"

              >CCPA</a>. As a merchant, it's your responsibility to have an active command of
              the cookies delivered by your site, and to communicate to your users:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>the purpose and scope of cookies on your site</li>
              <li>how and why information about your users is collected</li>
              <li>what kind of information about your users is collected</li>
              <li>when information about your users is collected</li>
              <li>how information about your users is used</li>
              <li>for how long information about your users is stored</li>
              <li>how to opt out of personal data collection, in part or in full</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Your obligations to disclose information about personal data collection
              will vary depending on where you do business. Please note that the data
              privacy communication obligations listed above are only provided as
              suggestions of industry best practices. While these reccomendations are
              a good starting point, it is the merchant's responsibility to seek out
              and act on the legal advice of an attorney before collecting or
              processing users' personal information.
